## About me

I'm 25 now and I've been studying Web Development since august 2022. I have a degree in economy and experience of few years working in banking and mortgage insurance.
I really enjoy the process of learning and programming. I'm interested in Web Development because of its possibilities for professional growth and creative implementation at the same time. Also I like that there are a lot of free resources for self-education and get motivation on this path.
I believe, that my ability to learn and to gain new skills will help me to become Frontend Developer.
