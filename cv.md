## About me

I'm 25 now and I've been studying Web Development since august 2022. I have a degree in economy and experience of few years working in banking and mortgage insurance.
I really enjoy the process of learning and programming. I'm interested in Web Development because of its possibilities for professional growth and creative implementation at the same time. Also I like that there are a lot of free resources for self-education and get motivation on this path.
I believe, that my ability to learn and to gain new skills will help me to become Frontend Developer.

## Skills

- HTML and CSS (BEM methodology)
- JavaScript (fundamentals, asynchronous JS, OOP, ES6+, DOM, JSON)

## Code example

A Needle in the Haystack Kata from Codewars: \*Write a function findNeedle() that takes an array full of junk but containing one "needle". After your function finds the needle it should return a message (as a string) that says:
"found the needle at position " plus the index it found the needle.\*

```
function findNeedle(haystack) {
  return `found the needle at position ${haystack.findIndex(i => i == "needle")}`
}
```
